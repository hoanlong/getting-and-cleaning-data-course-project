### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: README.Rm

Edition of March 2016.

#### Project description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work 
with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used 
for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no 
questions related to the project. 
You will be required to submit: 

1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, 
and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo 
explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
